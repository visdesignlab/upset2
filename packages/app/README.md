# UpSet 2.0 App Package

This package represents the Multinet wrapper around the UpSet react component. This handles any interaction with Multinet as a sort of middleware.

Any API calls to Multinet are made from here, and any information regarding UI that is NOT part of the Upset plot is handled and passed on here.
