# Getting Started with UpSet 2

There are two main methods to use UpSet 2.0. This is through the [website](./on-the-web/index.md) and/or through the [React component](./upset2-react.md) hosted on [npm.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@visdesignlab/upset2-react).

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
