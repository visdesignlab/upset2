# UpSet 2 on the Web

To use UpSet 2.0 in your web browser, simply navigate to [upset.multinet.app](https://upset.multinet.app).

:::note

Officially, only Google Chrome is supported by UpSet 2.0, but many features are also tested on Firefox and should work.

Upon navigating to the website, you should be met with a homepage which features some example plots. These are pre-configured and act as example/toy datasets which you can use to familiarize yourself with UpSet 2.0's features.
