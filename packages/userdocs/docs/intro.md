# Introduction

UpSet 2.0 is an interactive, web based visualization technique designed to analyze set-based data.

UpSet 2.0 is available at [upset.multinet.app](https://upset.multinet.app) and also available as a modular [react component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@visdesignlab/upset2-react).
