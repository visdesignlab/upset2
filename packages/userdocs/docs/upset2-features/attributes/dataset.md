# Dataset Attributes

Attributes can be built into the dataset. These are required to be numeric or date fields. An example of this could be the average rating for a movie.

As with [derived attributes](built-in#built-in--derived-attributes), these attributes can be enabled or disabled using the settings sidebar or the attribute column headers. Additionally, the plot can be sorted by attributes. For more information on sorting, see [sorting by attributes](../sorting-and-filtering#sort-by-dataset-attribute). Unlike derived attributes, however, there is no aggregation option for dataset attributes.
