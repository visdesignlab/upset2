# About UpSet 2.0

UpSet 2.0 is an interactive, web based visualization technique designed to analyze set-based data. UpSet visualizes both, set intersections and their properties, and the items (elements) in the dataset.

Please see the [upset.app](https://upset.app) for more info about UpSet.

This version is a re-implementation using modern web technologies of [the original UpSet](https://vdl.sci.utah.edu/publications/2014_infovis_upset/).

UpSet 2 is described in this short poster:
